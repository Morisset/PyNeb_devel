* emisGrid/plotContours now have a level keyword.
* N3r and N5r added to LINE_LABEL_LIST dictionnary defined in utils/init.py
* o_i_coll_ZT03 added to atomic data
* HeI labels now have a dot after the wavelength (ex: 4471. instead of 4471)
* IPs from utils/physics are now generated also for H and He
recombination lines can now be used in emisGrid
* parseAtom2 returns rec='r' code to identify recombination atoms 
* Some minor bugs corrected

* Add the option of using Artificial Neural Network to speed-up getCrossTemDen. This implies the library AI4neb is installed (https://github.com/Morisset/AI4neb) with Tensorflow and Scikit-learn. This will be described in a forthcoming paper, any information can be asked using the Google group.

* File requierements.dev added to root directory (only for developpers).
* A lot of docstrings have been modified to prepare the API documentation
* Directory pyneb/docs reorganized
* A workflow directory is added to automatize the API documentation (all this from MJChimal fork)
