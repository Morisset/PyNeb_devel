The ICFs of NeIII from PHC07 were incorrectly attributed to NeII. Bug corrected.
Two ICFs changed:
RR04 changed for the more updated RR05
GRal04_10a, b are in fact special cases of a PTPR92 icf. GRal0410a, b have been changed for PTPR92_21
Two ICF added for Fe by RR05, based on observational data

The headers of a few atomic data files were updated (e.g., 'gs' added to 'Fe3', recombination files now have references)

A new function pn.atomicData.printAllSources has been added to display the atomic data 
references of all ions at once (or a specified subset of them)

A new function printSources added to recombination lines

A new function plotLineRatio has been added to EmisGrid

A warning is issued in plotGrotrian when a level inversion is found

Ascii data can be read directly from Atom, the filename extension must be ".dat". Two new Objects AtomDataAscii and CollDataAscii are called when .dat files are used. They are similar to AtomDataFits and CollDataFits and should issue the same methods. 

Some reorganisation of the methods from AtomDataFits, etc to Atom.

Multiprocessing can be used to compute Atom.getTemDen on massive data. The number of processors Config.Nprocs is set by default by Config to mp.cpu_count(), can be changed at any time. Multiprocs use is set/unset by Config.use_multiprocs() and Config.unuse_multiprocs()

RecAtom is more similar to Atom, with getIonAbund accepting to_eval keyword.

Some new lines and blends:
LINE_LABEL_LIST['C4'] = ['1548A', '1551A']
BLEND_LIST['C4_1550A+'] = 'I(2,1)+I(3,1)'
BLEND_LIST['O3_1664A+'] = 'L(1660)+L(1666)'
BLEND_LIST['O4_1400A+'] = 'I(3,1)+I(3,2)+I(4,1)+I(4,2)+I(5,1)+I(5,2)'
BLEND_LIST['N3_1751A+'] = 'I(3,1)+I(3,2)+I(4,1)+I(4,2)+I(5,1)+I(5,2)'
BLEND_LIST['Ne4_2423A+'] = 'I(2,1)+I(3,1)'

By default, the pypics files are now stored in a .pypics directory in the CURRENT directory, and not anymore in the $HOME directory. This allows to easily have different pypics files for different projects, without recomputing them each time one change the working project.

Atom.atomFitsFile and Atom.collFitsFile are deprecated, prefer Atom.atomFile and Atom.collFile
