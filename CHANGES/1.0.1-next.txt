The names of the extinction laws have been rationalized and the documentation has been improved to correct several misplaced bibliographic references.

He I label 4472A has been changed into 4471A in LINE_LABEL_LIST for coherence with the label of the transition '4471.0'

A new function getWave has been added to RecAtom to recover the wavelength from levels

Changed authorship of two Ar ICFs in the code (formerly PHCD07_14 and PHCD07_15, now become ITL94_19 and ITL94_20, since ITL94 is the original reference). Added Argon ICF from PHCD07 (eqs. 16 and 17).

Added Cl III transition probabilities by Fritszche et al 1999, ApJ 518, 992	

Added complete reference to header of He I files (“Porter 2012” -> “Porter et al. 2012, MNRAS 425, 28”, “Porter 2012 corrected 2013” -> "Porter et al. 2012, MNRAS 425, 28, corrected as in Porter et al 2013, MNRAS, 433, 89”). 

He I files renamed for consistency with file naming conventions: 
he_i_rec_P12.fits -> he_i_rec_Pal12.fits
and
he_i_rec_Pal12corr13.fits -> he_i_rec_Pal12-Pal13.fits

Total recombination coefficients for case A and B (default) for HI and HeII are now available (module getTotRecombination).

Several ICFs attributed to KB94 were in fact illegal combinations of the equations of the KB94 paper and have now been deleted.
The docstring of the remaining ICFs have been clarified.

Added atomic data for Fe IV, FeV, Fe VI, Fe VII

Added hybrid FFT04-SZ00 atomic data file (FFT A’s everywhere except for 5007 and 4959, taken from SZ00).  

Corrected a bug in Grotrian plots that caused fractional J values (1/2, 3/2, etc.) to be misrepresented. The bug was present since mid 2014 (it was introduced when NIST files started to be used for energy levels). 

printAllSources() now accepts also atomic species (not only ions) as input (e.g.: pn.atomicData.printAllSources([O, S]))

**********

Internal use:

pyfits is now looked for in the astropy package too
