NEW: when using ipython 2.0, the book is not avalaible anymore!!! Use report instead (less nice, but shorter). 
Actually we will use a customized version of report that change sections to chapters. It requires mytemplate.tplx

ipython nbconvert --to latex --template mytemplate --post PDF PyNeb_Handbook


OLD:

ipython nbconvert --to latex --template book --post PDF PyNeb_Handbook

This makes the tex file and the pdf. But, as we want the following inbetween, better not to put the --post PDF and compile the PDF by hand later.

To add after the last usepackage:
\usepackage{chngcntr}
\counterwithin{chapter}{part}

Don't forget to change the authors names.
